    <h1>Personal hygiene</h1> 
    <p>One of the most effective ways we have to protect ourselves and others from illness is good personal hygiene. This means washing your hands, especially, but also your body. It means being careful not to cough or sneeze on others, cleaning things that you touch if you are unwell, putting items such as tissues (that may have germs) into a bin when you might be at risk of catching an infection.</p> 

     
    <h1>Body odor</h1>
<p>Such as bathing, is very much dependent on the culture in which you live. In some cultures, it is expected that you will wash your body at least every day and use deodorants to stop body smells. Other cultures have different expectations. Body smells are caused by a number of factors working in combination, including:
Chemicals in sweat, including pheromones, which are made by the body.
Wastes excreted through the skin, such as metabolised alcohol.
The actions of bacteria that live on the skin and feed on dead skin cells and sweat.
    Unwashed clothes, such as underwear and socks.</p>

    <h1>Hand washing</h1>
<p> Most infections, especially colds and gastroenteritis, are caught when we put our unwashed hands, which have germs on them, to our mouth. Some infections are caught when other peopleâ€™s dirty hands touch the food we eat. Hands and wrists should be washed with clean soap and water, using a brush if your fingernails are dirty. Dry your hands with something clean, such as paper towels or hot air dryers. You should always wash your hands:<br>
After using the toilet<br>
Before making or eating food<br>
After handling dogs or other animals<br>
If you have been around someone who is coughing or has a cold.<br>
